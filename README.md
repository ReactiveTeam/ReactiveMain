> **Reactive is a modular program perfect for personal or organization use. Think of it like a shapeshifter. Reactive loads your module, renders it, and spits out a completely new app.**

### Philosophy

Reactive does what you tell it to do - no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Reactive gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.

### Why?

* Because I was getting tired of having to install a whole application just to get to use a single feature of it but with this, it's **simple and easy to use.**
 - **Native UI:** It's sometimes ugly and doesn't always work the way you want. Lack of beautiful animations and is different between apps.
 - **Reactive:** Beautiful, web-based interface powered by Bootstrap & Vue.js

* Installation is long and I'm running out of hardisk space
 - **Old way:** installation times and hard-disk space
 - **Reactive:** install once, and small footprint on your hard-disk

* Components & plugins
 - **Old way:** `Unknown yet`
 - **Reactive:** It provides ability to create your own components using an extensible API (see [Building new components](https://reactiveteam.github.io/ReactiveSite/index.html) article for more info)
